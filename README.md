Technology Fundamentals Lecture Notes
==
This repo contains the LaTex source for a set of articles that I pulled together for lecturing core computing concepts. They were written and refined over a two year period. I used three books and the internet as source material. Each article indicates where appropriate the source of the material used.

Feel free to modify, distribute or otherwise re-use the notes in any way that doesn't violate copyright of any cited materials.
